# 100 Days of Python

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** journey using Python!  
This repository will serve as a journal and archive for all my daily code, projects, and learning notes.

## About

- **Goal:** Code every day for 100 days, focusing on Python.
- **Contents:** Daily scripts, mini-projects, challenges, and documentation of progress.
- **Purpose:** Improve my Python skills, build consistency, and explore new concepts.

## Structure

- Each dayâ€™s work will be organized in folders or files.
- Projects and larger challenges will have their own directories.
- Notes and reflections will be included to track my learning.

## Progress

I will update this README with milestones and highlights as I advance.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse the code, learn from my journey, and reach out if you have feedback or suggestions!
