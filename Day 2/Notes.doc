Today's learning objectives are:
1. Data Types
2. Numbers
3. Operations
4. Type Conversions
5. f-strings

Data Types
1. strings 2. Integer 3. Floats 4. Booleans

Pulling out a particular element from a string is called Subscripting.
Example:
print("Hello"[2])

This will print the third character (l) in the string "Hello" since we start counting from zero
in programming.

Integers are whole numbers; numbers without any decimals.
print("123" + "345") will output 123345 instead of the sum of the numbers because python still
sees them as strings not numbers. To sum the numbers, do this instead:

print(123 + 345) 

For large numbers like 123,456,789 we would need to write them like this 123_456_789
with underscores, so Python will be able to read them properly.

Numbers with decimals are simply called Floats. Example is pie, 3.14159.
Booleans are simply either True or False values.
