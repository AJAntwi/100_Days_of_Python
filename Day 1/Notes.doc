Pieces of text such as the Hello World in print("Hello World!") are known as Strings.
Strings are just strings of text.

In writing print commands, you can add "\n" to print multiple statements like so:

print("Hello World\nHello World") and it will be printed 2 times.

print("Hello World\nHello World\nHello World") and it will be printed 3 times.

We can also add multiple strings. This is known as "Concatenation". We use "+" sign to do this.
Example:
print("Hello" + "Augustine")

print("Hello " + "Augustine") would leave a space between "Hello" and "Augustine" when printed
because we have left a space right after the word, "Hello" in the string.

You can also just insert another string with a space in it like so:
print("Hello" + " " + "Augustine")

print functions are used to output strings.
input functions allow the user to input a response to the prompt. Like so:
input("What is your name? ")

Variables: This is a data type that allows you to store value for later use or reference.
Using the input example from earlier:

name = input("What is your name? ")

'name' here is the name of the variable we are using to store the name of the user.

Lets say we want to find the length of the user's name. How would we do this?
This brings us to the len() function and it is used this way:

name = "Jack"
print(len(name))

Lets say you want to print the length of the name the user inputs. Do this in one line of code.
Answer: print(len(input("What is your name?")))

OR 

name = input("What is your name? ")
print(len(name))

OR 

username = input("What is your name? ")
length = len(username)
print(length)

We have 2 variables glass1 and glass2. glass1 contains milk and glass2 contains juice.
Write 3 lines of code to switch the contents of the variables.
You are not allowed to type the words "milk" or "juice".
You are only allowed to use variables to solve this exercise. 

glass1 = "milk"
glass2 = "juice"

Answer:
Glass3 = glass2
Glass4 = glass1
print(Glass3 + "\n" + Glass4)
